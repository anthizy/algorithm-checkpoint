The checkpoint basically gave us three instructions which to write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.

Using three variables as counters , my variables are;
charCount(for counting number of charaters)
wordCount(for counting number of words)
vowelCount(for counting number of vowels)

following instruction 1 (The length of the sentence (the number of characters)) after declaring the variables;
  loop count number of charaters in the given sentence (i am a web developer.) then I declar variable charCount to run from 0 to the last index which is  (sentence.length)-1 
following instruction 2 (The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space))after declaring the variables;
  loop  count number of words in the given sentence (i am a web developer.) then I declar variable wordcount to run from 0 to the last index which is (words.length)-1 
following instruction 3 (The number of vowels in the sentence.) after declaring the variables;
  loop  count number of vowels in the given sentence (i am a web developer.) then I declar variable vowelcount to run from 0 to the last index which is (vowels.length)-1
